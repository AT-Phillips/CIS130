    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <p>My main hobby is playing guitar. I love music (who doesn't?), and I've been playing
        guitar since I was 12. It's been an enjoyable journey. I've learned
        about all kinds of genres, styles, and techniques. I ended up
        getting into recording about 10 years ago and now record and produce my own music.
        I'm tech savvy so I learned how to build computers in my early 20's and built
        a computer that could handle the multi-threaded processes that music production
        demands. It also doesn't hurt that it performs well at gaming! Thanks for reading!
